                  <p>Here's what <span id="title">The New York Times</span> has to say about Brooklyn Flea: "One of the great urban experiences in New York." Flea has accomplished this feat in less than ten years. You can browse through antiques, vintage clothing, jewelry, collectibles, and arts and crafts.

                <p>Chinatown is located in one of the city's oldest neighborhoods. It has retained the small mom-and-pop stores that have disappeared elsewhere in Manhattan. The produce is beautifully displayed and among the freshest in the city. Looking for 19th century Chinese antiques?

                   <p>The Strand has 2.5 million volumes of new, used, and rare books. Ben Bass started the
                store in 1927 on New York's Book Row. Book Row consisted of forty-eight secondhand bookstores on Fourth Avenue in the six blocks from Union Square to Astor Place. The Strand is the only one left. For more information, click <a href="http://www.strandbooks.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>Who introduced New Yorkers to Brie cheese? Zabar's. Louis Zabar started out by renting a stall in a farmer's market.
